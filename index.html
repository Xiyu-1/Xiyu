                  <h2>A brief history of Hispanic immigrants in the Gulf of Mexico area</h2>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Gulf of Mexico area has always been one of the major destinations of Hispanic Immigrants to the United States because of warm and humid weather, large Latino population base, prevailing language (Spanish), and similar culture atmosphere, etc. Specifically, Mexico appeared among the top-five immigration nations to the three Gulf states (Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama) in 2000. Mexico represented the national origin of eight percent of the foreign-born population in Louisiana and 27.7 percent in Mississippi and Alabama. So what job they do in these three states? In the early 1990s, Mexican migrants came to Louisiana to work in shipbuilding and fabrication yards in the southern coastal areas of the state, and many in Mississippi and Alabama were employed in casino construction or in forestry.

              <h2>Household income</h2>
              </div>
              <p>Household income figure shows a different income level of Hispanic Immigrants among different Gulf states. Overall, Hispanic Immigrants in Texas has a high household income, however, in-state like Florida, they are more likely to have a low household income. Cities in Louisiana present a large gap between each other, as average household income in Lafayette is $49,070 (highest in research area) while that in Houma is only $28,944 (lowest in research area). Gulfport (Mississippi) and Mobile (Alabama) are the only one city of their state near the coast. The household income of these two cities is in the middle position. This figure presents a relatively huge household income gap for Hispanic Immigrants who have low-income parents.</p>

            <div style="padding-top:50px;">
              <h2>Individual income</h2>
              </div>
              <p>Things are similar for individual income. While cities in Texas remain high, cities in Florida split into two parts. And the individual income gap inside Louisiana becomes higher. The individual income of Houma only equals about half of the individual income of Lafayette. Both of them are in the same state. Unlike the situation in household income, Mobile (Alabama) is the third from the last for individual income, as Gulfport (Mississippi) remains the middle position. This figure presents a relatively huge individual income gap for Hispanic Immigrants who have low-income parents.</p>

              <h2>Hourly salary</h2>
              </div>
              <p>As there is no data for an hourly wage of Hispanic immigrant children of low-income parents, I choose the hourly wage data for Hispanic children of low-income parents. The result shows a dramatic reverse compared to the former visualizations. Florida and Louisiana, replacing Texas, are likely to have higher hourly wages for Hispanic children of low-income parents, though gaps still exist between cities in these two states. Houma unexpectedly becomes the city with the highest hourly wage - $18 per hour, while Lafayette has the lowest hourly wage. However, some cities like Houston and Miami maintain both a high-level hourly income for the Hispanic population and a high-level household/individual income for Hispanic immigration.</p>

<img border="1" src="viz\hourly_wage.png" alt="" / width="700" height="500">
              <p>A possible explanation is brought up for this phenomenon. As in Houma, the children of the local poor Hispanic population are paid well, while the children of poor Hispanic immigrants tend to have low household income and individual income. This may be resulting from the saturation of some professions consisting mainly of Hispanic populations in the local employment market. Due to a lack of technical skills, lack of trust by local employers, and probably lack of English skills, Hispanic immigrant children are more likely to be replaced by the local Hispanic population. Therefore, those areas with high-income levels for the Hispanic population are not definitely to be suitable for Hispanic Immigrants, or vice versa. However, in some big cities like Houston and Miami, children of poor Hispanic immigrants will get a higher income as well as the local Hispanic groups, because of large market labor demand and potentially fewer immigrants discrimination.</p>
